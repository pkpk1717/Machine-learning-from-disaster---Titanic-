## Machine learning from disaster - Titanic predictions

This notebook uses the dataset from kaggle and tries to predict the survivals of the titanic incident. The survival are based on many features such as 
age, sex, fare, embarked etc. 

It makes use of these machine learning regression algorithms :
1. Support vector classifier
2. KNeighbourCLassifier
3. Decision tree classification
4. Random forest 
5. Ada Boosting 
6. Gradient boosting
7. Logistic regression
8. Guassian NB

It then compares the best results from these algorithms. It uses all these algorithms in a pipeline.
